# Pariaconus Symbiont Genomes

Hawaiian Pariaconus psyllid species have undergone a rapid adaptive radiation on the Hawaiian Islands, evolving various galling and free-living ecologies on a single host plant species, Metrosideros polymorpha. In Hansen et al. (https://academic.oup.com/mbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msae190/7750144) we describe the genome sequences of three distinct endosymbionts lineages. The typical psyllid primary endosymbiont "Candidatus Carsonella ruddii", along with two novel symbiont lineages that we have named "Candidatus Makana argininalis" and "Candidatus Malihini olakiniferum". 

Genome sequences will be available with GenBank annotations linked to PRJNA1125431 under BioSample numbers SAMN41940397-SAMN41940408. Annotations used in the paper are available here.
