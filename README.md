# Pariaconus Symbiont Genomes

Hawaiian *Pariaconus* psyllid species have undergone a rapid adaptive radiation on the Hawaiian Islands, evolving various galling and free-living ecologies on a single host plant species, *Metrosideros polymorpha*. In Hansen et al. (https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msae190) we describe the genome sequences of three distinct endosymbionts lineages. The typical psyllid primary endosymbiont "*Candidatus* Carsonella ruddii", along with two novel symbiont lineages that we have named "*Candidatus* Makana argininalis" and "*Candidatus* Malihini olakiniferum". 

Genome sequences will be available with GenBank annotations linked to PRJNA1125431 under BioSample numbers SAMN41940397-SAMN41940408. Annotations used in the paper are available here.
